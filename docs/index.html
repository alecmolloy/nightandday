<h2>Event description</h2>

<p>We come together to celebrate<br>
From very early to very late</p>

<p>We will meet during the day<br>
For grown up and much needed play</p>

<p>There will be drinking, it might get silly<br>
(But nobody will be allowed to show their willy)</p>


<p>We meet again during the night<br>
To learn to grow our inner light</p>

<p>The mysteries we’ll meet in shadows<br>
Are too much to right now disclose</p>

<p>We’ll face deep fears for humankind<br>
Play with the illusions in our mind</p>


<p>We will be brave, even in our sleep<br>
To make the learnings thus more deep</p>

<p>Explore ourselves, our lives, our death<br>
To enjoy ying and yang in our every breath</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>Leave us a message of your voice<br>
Under this whatsapp number of choice</p>

<p>Tell us what you imagine in those days<br>
How we’re coming together, in which ways</p>

<p>Imagine up the world ahead<br>
Explain it in a single thread</p>

<p>But speak your words in beautiful rhyme<br>
So to the top of our attendance list you can climb</p>

<p>The cost will be low, maximum 150 quid<br>
Which we think is fair for this event bid</p>

<p>Only twelve spots are there to take<br>
So apply now and save yourself from heartache.</p>
